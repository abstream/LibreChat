            201700413, and a registered office at Tsarigradsko Shose Blvd No. 115M, European Trade

            1. A Platform for Open Exploration (Omnexio)
          </h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Omnexio is a platform that provides users with access to a diverse range of third-party
            Large Language Models ("LLMs"), including but not limited to those developed by OpenAI,
            Anthropic, DeepSeek, Meta, Google, and Alibaba ("Third-Party AI Models"). These models
            power various agents that users may interact with for purposes such as learning, writing
            assistance, translation, programming support, summarization, entertainment, and other
            applications. Each agent is accompanied by a profile that includes a description and the
            identity of the company, developer, or individual responsible for its creation. Omnexio
            serves solely as an aggregator and interface, facilitating access to these Third-Party
            AI Models and their associated agents. Omnexio does not generate AI outputs itself and
            is not responsible for the content, services, or performance of the Third-Party AI
            Models or agents. Omnexio reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to add, remove, or
            update the Third-Party AI Models available on the platform at any time without prior
            notice.
          </p>

            parent or legal guardian must consent to these Omnexio Terms of Service and affirm that
            they accept these Terms on your behalf and bear responsibility for your use. Bots

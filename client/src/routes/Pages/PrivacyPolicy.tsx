            <li>
              <span className="font-medium">Account Information.</span> We collect your email
              address to create an account and verify your identity. We also create a user ID for
              your Omnexio account. If you are an existing Omnexio user, your name,
              Omnexio-associated email address, profile photo, and Omnexio user ID will be used to
              link your Omnexio account to your Omnexio account. Depending on your location, we may
              also ask you to provide your date of birth to verify your age. We use this information
              to communicate with you, troubleshoot issues, and provide updates on the latest
              Omnexio features. This processing is necessary to comply with our legal and
              contractual obligations to you.

            <li>
              <span className="font-medium">Device Information.</span> We collect your device type

            </li>
            <li>
              <span className="font-medium">Third Party Application Login.</span> You can log into
              your Omnexio account using third-party applications (e.g., Google and Apple). When you
              log in using this method, we collect your name and email address associated with that
              third-party application for authentication and identity verification purposes. This
              processing is necessary to comply with our contractual obligations to you.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span className="font-medium">Subscription Billing Data.</span> We use a third-party
              service provider to collect and process your billing information when you subscribe to
              Omnexio. The information our billing provider collects may include your name, billing
              address, your credit or debit card details, and email address. This processing is
              necessary to comply with our contractual obligations to you.

              information, such as your tax ID and address, with our tax service provider. This
              processing is necessary to comply with our legal and contractual obligations to you.

              <span className="font-medium">Advertising.</span> We collect information about you
              when you interact with Omnexio ads to measure the effectiveness of our ad campaigns.
              This information includes your IP address, advertising ID, and ad interaction

              third-party AI model LLM providers and third-party bot developers may receive details
              about your interactions with bots on Omnexio (including the contents of your chats) to

              legitimate business interests. Your Omnexio user account information (e.g., username
              and email) is not shared with our third-party AI model providers or developers.
              Third-party developers that create bots on Omnexio using APIs may view and store your
              anonymized chats on their servers to train their models. We may use your interactions
              on Omnexio to provide you a personalized experience, such as recommending other bots
              to explore or topics to discuss.

            is no need to share sensitive personal information with the bots (e.g., credit card
            information, social security information, etc.). For more information about the
            third-party AI model providers and bot developers, please see the respective bot
